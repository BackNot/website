We want to adopt OWASP SAMM 2.0 at my workplace. Can you recommend a company to help us do this?
SAMM team members get asked this a lot through the different channels of communication like our Slack channel and the contact form on the website.
Obviously, we know many companies, organizations, and individuals who can do this. We are a community-driven project and a number of volunteers have contributed to SAMM so it wasnâ€™t an easy answer for us to provide.</description></item></channel></rss>
