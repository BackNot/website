## Who to contact for SAMM services

Who is a SAMM practitioner? Anyone who provides assessment, roadmap services, or tools based on the whole SAMM model.

We've put together a list of SAMM practitioners you can contact to get your organization on the path to a better security posture. 

While the OWASP SAMM project is selective about the practitioners we list, it does NOT imply we endorse, recommend, or favor any of them.
- SAMM practitioners are linked on the OWASP SAMM website as a convenience â€” their inclusion is not a direct recommendation or endorsement.
- OWASP cannot guarantee the quality of practitioners' products or their services. It's the responsibility of each user to vet potential practitioners to determine whether they meet their needs.
- In no event will OWASP be responsible for damages of any nature whatsoever resulting from the use of or reliance upon the featured practitioners or the services they provide.

### Who makes the list

To add SAMM practitioners to the list

- the SAMM practitioner has to request to be on the list.
- the SAMM practitioner has to provide a link to its SAMM related service offering (SAMM assessment, roadmap, or tools).
- the SAMM service offering of the practitioner has to contain a reference and link to https://owaspsamm.org/.

The OWASP SAMM project team reserves the right to reject or remove SAMM practitioners from this list at any time.
