## Thank you!

Thank you for being a part of our first SAMM User Day of 2021, which took place on May 27th.

## Presentations

If you have something you'd like to talk or hear about, remember there will be one more opportunity this year. Don't hesitate to [get in touch](/contact).

## More User Days

In 2021 we'll have 2 User Days, the one we had on May 27th and another one around November.

Based on feedback from last year, we decided to have 2 shorter User Days instead of just one that lasts all day.

## Archive

You can always visit last year's SAMM User Day page, where you can see the full list of talks, with downloadable material and YouTube links.
