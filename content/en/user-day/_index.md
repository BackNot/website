## Mini User Day - December 2021

We did not get around to organizing a Fall User Day as announced earlier this year but we used our last community call of 2021 to deliver:

- {{< external-link "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7otI-AhOeU&ab_channel=OWASPSAMM" "a deep dive on Bootstrapping and scoping a SAMM project">}}

Thank you for being part of the OWASP SAMM community!
