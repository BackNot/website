## One more get together

We did not get around to organizing a Fall User Day as announced earlier this year but we will use our last community call of 2021 to deliver:
- our OWASP 20th anniversary presentation of SAMM
- a deep dive on Bootstrapping and scoping a SAMM project

<br>
So, block your agendas for <b>Wednesday, December 8th</b> at 21:30 CET, which is 3:30 pm EST.

Looking forward to seeing you online next week!
