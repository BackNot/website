Community calls We host community calls on the second Wednesday of every month. Here, we provide project updates, do model deep-dive sessions and interact with the community of SAMM users. This goes from helping out people who are getting started with SAMM to discussing tools and ways to go about the different SAMM activities.</description></item></channel></rss>
