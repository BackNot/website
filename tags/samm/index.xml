The one that holds the threat, and later the reality, of many sleepless nights. The newest vulnerability is here and its severity is considered critical.
This Log4J vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228) has caused quite the stir, and rightfully so. It’s kept security peeps on our toes for the last few months so it was interesting to see this topic come up during our last SAMM monthly community call.</description></item><item><title>OWASP SAMM Train the Trainer</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/blog/2021/11/30/owasp-samm-train-the-trainer/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/blog/2021/11/30/owasp-samm-train-the-trainer/</guid><description>Expanding awareness of OWASP SAMM To introduce new users to the OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM), the SAMM project team has presented their one-day overview training class several times each year. These classes often run in conjunction with OWASP&amp;rsquo;s global and regional conference events. The instructors for that training class - currently titled &amp;ldquo;Secure Your SDLC using OWASP SAMM - ASAP!&amp;rdquo; - have usually been the project&amp;rsquo;s leaders, Sebastien (Seba) Deleersnyder and Bart de Win, or other SAMM team members.</description></item><item><title>Towards a well-governed SAMM Suite</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/blog/2021/03/23/samm-suite/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/blog/2021/03/23/samm-suite/</guid><description>Improving the velocity of OWASP SAMM Some years back, SAMM was a typical old school documentation project. Creation of all the documents was a purely manual and error-prone process. We fought a very complicated manual build procedure of the project PDF which only a few people knew how to deal with. Already fixed errors kept reappearing and it was hard to know who actually had the latest version in their mailbox.</description></item><item><title>OWASP SAMM Roadmap</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/blog/2021/02/09/owasp-samm-roadmap/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/blog/2021/02/09/owasp-samm-roadmap/</guid><description>What happened in 2020? This was a special year but still a lot happened for SAMM. The team worked hard to continue delivering and adding value for our users.
New version, new website, new ways of getting together In 2020 we launched OWASP SAMM v2.0, more than 10 years after OpenSAMM v1.0 was launched on March 25th, 2009 by Pravir Chandra.
Throughout 2020 we developed and released a new website and promoted the launch of SAMM v2.</description></item><item><title>Comparing BSIMM &amp; SAMM</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/blog/2020/10/29/comparing-bsimm-and-samm/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/blog/2020/10/29/comparing-bsimm-and-samm/</guid><description>Building Security In Maturity Model (BSIMM) compared to Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) A common origin BSIMM (Building Security In Maturity Model) and SAMM (Software Assurance Maturity Model) have similar origins dating back to a common origin back in 2008-2009. I’m frequently asked about what is similar and what is different between the two models, so I wrote up this comparison to help organizations understand which of these two models may be a better fit for their needs.</description></item></channel></rss>
